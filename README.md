## Prerequisites

⚠️ **Important:** Before using this integration, you must:


1. Reset your Glance Clock to factory settings
2. (Optional) Update the firmware
3. Synchronize the time using the [bluetooth-cts Home Assistant add-on](https://github.com/PorlyBe/bluetooth-cts)
4. Pair with your system's Bluetooth

### Step 1: Factory Reset Your Glance Clock

Before setup, perform a complete factory reset on your Glance Clock. This ensures a clean state for pairing and configuration.

**To reset your Glance Clock:**

Hold the reset button + Power button. Let go of the reset button and keep holding the Power button until the LED blinking pattern changes. Then release it as well.

NOTE: this will also reset the firmware back to the factory version.



### Step 2: (Optional) Update Firmware

If you wish to update your Glance Clock's firmware, you can use the nRF Connect app to perform a Device Firmware Update (DFU):

#### Download nRF Connect

- **Android**: [nRF Connect on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp)
- **iOS**: [nRF Connect on App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nrf-connect-for-mobile/id1054362403)

#### Update Firmware Steps

1. Download the latest firmware from the [`/firmware`](firmware/) directory in this repository.
2. Open the nRF Connect app on your phone.
3. Go to the **Scanner** tab and find your Glance Clock in the device list.
4. Tap **Connect** to connect to your Glance Clock.
5. Tap the **DFU** icon (circular arrows) in the top right corner.
6. Select **Distribution packet (ZIP)** when prompted.
7. Browse and select the firmware ZIP file you downloaded.
8. Tap **Start** to begin the update. Wait for the update to complete (do not disconnect). The clock will restart automatically when finished.

For more details, see the [original instructions](https://github.com/Hypfer/glance-clock).

### Step 3: Add Bluetooth CTS Home Assistant Add-on

The Glance Clock requires time synchronization before use. This can now be done easily using the [bluetooth-cts Home Assistant add-on](https://github.com/PorlyBe/bluetooth-cts), which provides a GATT Current Time Service (CTS) server for your clock to sync with.

**To set the time:**

1. Install the [bluetooth-cts add-on](https://github.com/PorlyBe/bluetooth-cts) in Home Assistant (follow the instructions in that repository).
2. Start the add-on so it advertises the Current Time Service (CTS) over Bluetooth.
3. Once your Glance Clock is connected in the next step, the time will automatically sync.
4. Leave the add-on running to keep your clock in sync with Home Assistant time.

### Step 4: Pair Your Glance Clock with Home Assistant

After resetting and setting the time, pair the clock with Home Assistant.

Open a terminal in Home Assistant (Settings → System → Terminal) and run:

```bash
bluetoothctl
agent on
default-agent
scan on
```

Wait until you see your Glance Clock appear (look for "Glance" in the name). Note the MAC address (format: `XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`), then:

```bash
pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
```

Replace `XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX` with your actual MAC address. When prompted, enter the PIN shown on the Glance Clock display, then exit:

```bash
exit
```

Your Glance Clock is now paired and ready to add to Home Assistant.

## Entities

Once configured, the integration provides:

- **Light** - Control brightness and power state
- **Switches** - Time Mode, Night Mode, Always Show Points, Mute, DND, and quiet schedules
- **Numbers** - Activity timeout and DND/silent schedule hours
- **Buttons** - Stop Timer, Stop Alarm, Stop Scenes, and Start Scenes
- **Selects** - Date Format and firmware 1.6.6+ Factory Demo options
- **Sensors** - Battery level percentage and decoded BLE State Word diagnostics
- **Notify** - Send notifications via `notify.glance_clock`


## Using Icons in Notifications

You can include icons in your Glance Clock notifications by inserting special codes in your message text. To add an icon, use `[icon:CODE]` in your message (for example: `Wake up! [icon:128]`).

See the full list of available icon codes and their meanings in [ICONS.md](./ICONS.md).

## Services

### Send Notification

Send a custom notification to your Glance Clock.

**Service:** `notify.glance_clock`

```yaml
service: notify.glance_clock
data:
  message: "Meeting in 5 minutes!"
  data:
    title: "Calendar Reminder"
    animation: "pulse"
    sound: "bells"
    color: "blue"
    priority: "high"
```

**Parameters:**

- `message` (required): Notification text
- `title`: Notification title
- `animation`: Animation effect (none, pulse, wave, fire, wheel, flower, sun, thunderstorm, cloud)
- `sound`: Sound effect (none, waves, rise, bells, radar, hello, complete)
- `color`: Display color (white, red, blue, lime, dark_orange, blue_violet, lawn_green)
- `priority`: Priority level (low, medium, high, critical)
- `text_modifier`: Text effect (none, repeat, rapid, delay)

### Update Display Settings

Configure display settings on your Glance Clock.

**Service:** `glance_clock.update_display_settings`

```yaml
service: glance_clock.update_display_settings
data:
  nightModeEnabled: true
  permanentMute: false
  permanentDND: false
  mgrUserActivityTimeout: 600
  dnd:
    recurring: true
    fromHour: 22
    tillHour: 7
  silent:
    recurring: true
    fromHour: 23
    tillHour: 6
  displayBrightness: 128
  timeModeEnable: true
  timeFormat12: false
  dateFormat: 1
```

Schedule hours are whole local hours (`0` through `23`); the reverse-engineered
firmware protocol does not expose schedule minutes. Destructive pairing/reset
commands and commands with unknown semantics are intentionally not exposed.

### Send Weather Forecast

Send weather forecast data with color gradients.

**Service:** `glance_clock.send_forecast`

```yaml
service: glance_clock.send_forecast
data:
  weather_entity: weather.home
  max_color: "#FF0000"
  min_color: "#0000FF"
```

### Send Rain Forecast

Send hourly precipitation as a dark-blue to cyan ring in scene slot 2. Values
are encoded in tenths of a millimetre. The scene is graphics-only, matching the
v2 app's `chanceOfRainAsGraphics` behavior; the clock does not show rain text.

```yaml
service: glance_clock.send_rain_forecast
data:
  weather_entity: weather.home
  max_value: 2
  min_color: "#000010"
  max_color: "#00BFFF"
```

### Read Current Settings

Retrieve current device settings.

**Service:** `glance_clock.read_current_settings`

### Refresh Entities

Force refresh all entity states.

**Service:** `glance_clock.refresh_entities`

## Automations

### Weather Forecast Automation

Automatically update your Glance Clock with weather forecast data whenever it changes.

1. Go to **Settings** → **Automations & Scenes**
2. Click **Create Automation** → **Create new automation**
3. Click the three dots (⋮) and select **Edit in YAML**
4. Paste the following configuration:

```yaml
alias: Weather Update
description: Update Glance Clock with weather forecast
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id:
      - weather.forecast_home  # Replace with your weather entity
conditions: []
actions:
  - action: glance_clock.send_forecast
    data:
      weather_entity: weather.forecast_home  # Replace with your weather entity
      max_color: [255, 102, 0]    # Orange for hot temperatures
      min_color: [0, 120, 255]    # Blue for cold temperatures
      min_value: 0                # Minimum temperature scale (°C)
      max_value: 40               # Maximum temperature scale (°C)
  - action: glance_clock.send_notice
    data:
      text: Weather Updated
      animation: sun
      sound: none
      color: blue
      priority: medium
mode: single
```

5. Update `weather.forecast_home` to match your weather entity
6. Adjust `min_value` and `max_value` to suit your local temperature range
7. Click **Save** and give your automation a name

The clock will now automatically display a 24-hour temperature forecast with color gradients whenever the weather updates!

## Troubleshooting

### Integration won't add or connect

- Ensure your Glance Clock is **paired** with your system via Bluetooth (see Prerequisites)
- Verify the MAC address is correct (use `bluetoothctl devices` to list paired devices)
- Check that Home Assistant's Bluetooth integration is enabled and working
- Restart Home Assistant and try again

### Device shows as unavailable

- The Glance Clock may have gone to sleep or moved out of range
- Check Bluetooth adapter signal strength
- Re-pair the device if connection issues persist

### Notifications not appearing

- Ensure the Glance Clock is powered on and connected
- Check that the message text is not empty
- Try sending a simple notification without optional parameters

### Battery sensor shows unavailable

- Some Glance Clock models may not support battery reporting via Bluetooth
- Battery data updates periodically, not in real-time
